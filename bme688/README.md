BME AI-Studio can be use to train off of collected data if you can label it.
The sensor uses a heater to change the profile of what it can sense. 
It is sensitive to temperature and humidity. 

## Install 
```
./scripts/install.sh 
```

## Use
./scripts/sample 

## TODO 
1. Collect data on healthy and unhealthy crops.
2. Label attributes and train the data.
3. Can we sniff the soil and get the same data as the soil sensor.
